(** The [Make] functor is used to generate a reduction function for
    shapes.

    It is parametrized by:
    - a function to load the shape of an external compilation unit
    - some fuel, which is used to bound recursion when dealing with recursive
      shapes introduced by recursive modules. (FTR: merlin currently uses a
      fuel of 10, which seems to be enough for most practical examples)

    incomplete the partially reduced shape is returned. *)
